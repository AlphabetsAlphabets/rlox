# About
I was interested in creating a calculator, and that lead me to [crafting intrepreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
And I got very interested in following along to create the Lox programming language.
It's called jlox because the lox interpreter was written in java, and since this
this rendition is going to be written in Rust, it's going to be called rlox.

To follow development follow me on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/cerenitty)
